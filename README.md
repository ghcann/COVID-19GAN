# COVID-19GAN
COVID-19 Generative Adversarial Network 

COVID-19GAN is a StyleGAN2 generative advasarial network trained on the 'COVID-19 image data collection' Cohen et al. (2020). The goal of COVID-19GAN is to generate photorealistic images chest x-rays of COVID-19 patients from a modified dataset of the 'COVID-19 image data collection' images. 

# Requirements

The following requirements are derived from StyleGAN2 requirements. For more information visit: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2. 

Both Linux and Windows are supported.
Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
64-bit Python 3.6 installation. 
Anaconda3 with numpy 1.14.3 or newer.
TensorFlow 1.14 or 1.15 with GPU support. 
The code does not support TensorFlow 2.0.
On Windows, you need to use TensorFlow 1.14 â€” TensorFlow 1.15 will not work.
One or more high-end NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA drivers, CUDA 10.0 toolkit and cuDNN 7.5. 
To reproduce the results reported in the paper StyleGAN2, you need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 16 GB of DRAM.
Docker users: use the provided StyleGAN2 Dockerfile to build an image with the required library dependencies.
